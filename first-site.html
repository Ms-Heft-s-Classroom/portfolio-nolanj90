    <h2>my equipment</h2>
    

    <p>  

      The equipment I use is a wooden bat. I use this bat for mostly batting practice and sometimes we have wooden bat tournaments. The next piece of equipment I have is a metal bat i Use this in games and sometimes in practice. I also have a glove to use when I play 1st base and a helmet and batting gloves for when I go up to bat to hit.

    <h2>practice facility</h2>
 

    <p>

      I practice at slugger 2 times a week to practice hitting, and I also workout at power strength. I do these to help my velo off my bat go up. I also do it to be better at pitching and to be able to throw faster.
